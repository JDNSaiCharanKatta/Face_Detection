# Face_Detection
This project is a comprehensive implementation of a face detection system using the OpenCV. The system is designed to accurately detect and annotate faces in images and video streams. It leverages state-of-the-art algorithms and models to provide high performance and reliability.

## Features
Real-time Face Detection: Efficient detection of faces in live video streams.
Image Processing: Capability to process and detect faces in static images.
Multiple Face Detection: Detects and distinguishes multiple faces in a single frame.
Face Annotation: Provides bounding boxes and labels for detected faces.
High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced deep learning models for precise detection.
Platform Support: Compatible with various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
